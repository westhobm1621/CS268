      <h2>Creator: Benjamin Westholm</h2>
      <h2>Client: Realistic Randy</h2>

      <h3>Rubric</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Content
          <ul>
            <li>Is the content original, not placeholder text or copy lifted from elsewhere?</li>
              <dd>- All content is completely original. Obviously I did not make the videos, articles, or podcasts that 
                my client did but the way they are all displayed is my original design.
              </dd>
            <li>Does the site incorporate a form element?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The site incorporates a form element on the about page under the "About" subsection.</dd>
            <li>Does the site include links to other sites?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The site incorporates links to sites that contain Randy's podcasts and articles on the "Articles/Podcasts" page. 
                The site also incorporates links to Randy's social media pages in the ribbon as well as links to other content creators 
                and businesses mentioned in the "About" page.
              </dd>
            <li>Are there the required five separate pages?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The website includes a home, about, videos, podcasts/articles, and comedy page.</dd>
            <li>Does the page include a favicon?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. Each page on the website has the same favicon.</dd>
            <li>Does the page include an animation?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The videos page includes blinking yellow text that moves up and down that says "popular zone" under the subsection 
                 "popular videos".
              </dd>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Coherence and Contrast
          <ul>
            <li>Are the images appropriate to the theme?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. All images are appropriate for where they are placed in the website.</dd>
            <li>Are the images appropriately sized?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. All images have an easy to view size.</dd>
            <li>Are there strong axes of alignment?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. All content is aligned very neatly.</dd>
            <li>Is your style maintained across pages?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The way things are laid out as well as the colors of each page remain consistent throughout the website.</dd>
            <li>Is the spacing clean?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. Even spacing is implemented across the entire website.</dd>
            <li>Does the site include different fonts?</li>
              <dd>- Yes & no. There is a consistent font family that is used for the majority of the website, but there is a different 
                font used under the picutre of Randy on the homepage where it says "Mediokr At Best Sports Podcast" 
                (Which is purposefully mispelled). This is on purpose though as this font is part of the client's style.
              </dd>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Client-mindedness
          <ul>
            <li>Is the site designed with the client in mind rather than the designer?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The site represents the client's style and identity. As the designer, I made sure to include accurate 
                information about the client and make the website user friendly. 
              </dd>
            <li>Does your site appear appropriately on both mobile and desktop screens?</li>
              <dd>- Yes & no. The site works perfectly on desktop screens. I got the site to appear appropriately 
                on my iPhone screen, but as for other mobile screens I am not sure the content would be displayed well.</dd>
            <li>Is your site arranged in a navigable way?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The ribbon provides links to every page of the website. The ribbon does not provide links 
                on the homepage, but the homepage does provide large buttons to navigate to the other pages. 
              </dd>
            <li>Are images made accessible with alt attributes?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. All images have discriptive alt attributes.</dd>
            <li>Does the client report provide meaningful feedback?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The client's report is lengthy and well detailed. It provides feedback about aspects of the website 
                that users of it would most likely care about.
              </dd>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Project Organization
          <ul>
            <li>Are external CSS files used?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. All styling is done through external css files.</dd>
            <li>Is the site organized into folders as specified?</li>
              <dd>- Not yet.</dd>
            <li>Are classes and IDs used appropriately to apply styles at the right level of granularity?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. I am a little unsure about the granularity for the articles and podcasts html page but the rest of 
                the site's granularity is appropriate. 
              </dd>
            <li>Are selectors used appropriately?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. Selectors are used as instructed in css files.</dd>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Technical Soundness
          <ul>
            <li>Are lowercase filenames used?</li>
              <dd>- Not yet.</dd>
            <li>Is the site served over HTTPS on port 8443?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The set up for the project is done correctly.</dd>
            <li>Is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript readable?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. The indentation and spacing for all the files makes them readable.</dd>
            <li>Does your HTML and CSS pass all validation?</li>
              <dd>- Not all. All CSS pages do pass validation, but not all html pages. 
                The Articles and Podcasts page as well as this report page do not pass validation due to 
                nesting ul tags within ul tags or nesting dd tags in ul tags. I cannot figure out how to nest 
                these tags without losing the functionality and/or style I want.  
              </dd>
            <li>Is the site created without the aid of other libraries or frameworks?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. No outside libraries or frameworks were used.</dd>
            <li>Was there a steady flow of commits to Git?</li>
              <dd>- Yes. I committed and pushed to Git many times throughout working on the website.</dd>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Client's Critique</h2>
      <p>
        First off I love the organizing and compilation of the various types
        of content on the website such as articles with subtitles of relevance
        per article and podcast episodes. If I were to have a website this
        type of organization of content is what i'd cherish as it makes it
        easy for viewers to navigate to pieces that they find interesting to
        them.The video layout is well done in terms of the size of the
        thumbnails and the categories of recent and popular. This gives first
        time viewers the chance to get an idea of the podcast style (through
        the popular videos) along with the chance to get the latest content
        based on recent events in the sports world. The only changes I would
        recommend on the video page is to swap the category order (have the
        recent videos at the top of the screen and popular at the bottom)
        along with the title font color. Perhaps a change from black to white
        would be even more user friendly.<br><br>
        
        The comedy section really adds an extra form of light-heartedness to
        the page as is appreciated since comedy content is something that i've
        recently decided to add to the regular rotation of overall content. I
        like that the comedy videos go in descending order (most recent and
        backwards). The one thing I would change on the comedy page is to have
        it in a similar layout of the videos page as in have the comedy meme
        and comedy video category content spread across the page horizontally
        instead of vertically.<br><br>
        
        I think the about section is great as is with no change
        recommendations. It really lays out the type of presentation for
        viewers to expect from the show.<br><br>
        
        I like the layout of the home page. Large click areas are user friendly.<br><br>
        
        Overall the main change I would recommend for the website is to have
        some color variance, perhaps some white and yellow to add with the
        purple.<br><br>
        
        I am very impressed with the work that Ben has done for this website
        and am incredibly humbled to have the show as the subject for this
        project.<br><br>
