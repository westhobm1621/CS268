                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Realistic Randy is an independent sports podcaster and YouTuber who primarily covers the Minnesota Vikings. 
                        Randy combines his brutally honest opinions with a heavy dose of sarcasm 2-3 times a week on his YouTube channel 
                        where he gives his opinion on what the Vikings need to do in order to capture the endlessly elusive Lombardi Trophy.

                    <h2>Achievements</h2>
                    <p>
                        In just three short years of creating content, Randy now has a following of 4,980 followers on youtube and 
                        2,119 twitter followers. Randy's hard work has not gone unnoticed as he has collaborated with many other accomplished 
                        sports content creators like <a href = "https://www.skornorth.com/" target = "_blank">SKOR North</a> as well as 
                        Sean Kenner and Rick Sosa, creators of the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/ThePurpleCode/" target = "_blank">Purple Code</a>. 
                        Additionally, the Mediokr At Best Sports Podcast is currently sponsored by the Minneapolis brewery, <a href = "https://modistbrewing.com/" target = "_blank"> Modist Brewing Co.</a>

                    <h2>Why Sports Podcasting?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't always Randy's dream to be an independent sports podcaster. Considering Randy's hobbies include working out, listening 
                        to music, and cooking along with the fact that his college education earned him a Master of Business Administration degree; Randy's 
                        life didn't seem like it would lead to sports podcasting. In 2017 though, Randy founded the "Mediokr At Best Sports Podcast" 
                        and according to Randy himself it didn't take long for him to get hooked.

                    <h3 class = "quote">"I do sports podcasts because it's what I absolutely love doing. A friend suggested to try it years ago so 
                        I went ahead and never looked back." - Randy
                    </h3>
                    <h2>Randy's Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        Randy's primary goal as a sports podcaster is to always remain authentic. Whether or not he can find a company that encourages him 
                        to keep creating content he endorses or if he remains an independent content creator; Randy will always want his audience 
                        to hear his 100% unfiltered thoughts. Every take Randy delievers, whether it be a luke-warm or hot, is what he truly believes. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class = "quote">"The Mediokr at Best Sports Podcast is not a clickbait show with takes purposely driven to gain views. The show, my brand, is simply me." - Randy
